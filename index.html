                <h2>Idea</h2>
                <p>I thought about the potential of VR technology over the next 20 years in terms of high-tech socialization.
                    In my vision, VR devices will gradually replace our cell phones in the future. Here is my moodboard.
                    I'm going to design a VR glasses that I can carry around with me. In my imagination of the future,
                    this device replaces cell phones. People can plunge into the virtual world at any time.</p>

                <h2>Modeling</h2>
                <p>I made the prototype VR glasses out of rectangles and rings. After completing the base construction, 
                    I made two buttons out of cylinders. These two buttons are used to control the volume and the on/off switch separately.
                    The little knob in the third picture is being used to switch channels.

                    I'm having trouble with the modeling process. When I am trying to blend or delete some points,
                    I delete points on another model through one model. Therefore, I need to keep adjusting the angle during the process.

                <h2>Add Materials</h2>
                <p>I chose blue-violet as the main color for the lenses. Also I made it reflective by adjusting the refractive index.
                    The torus is a silver gray color with a metallic effect added.

              <h2>Make the design more reasonable</h2>
              <p>Considering that VR glasses need to be worn, I made an indentation to accommodate the nose.
                Also put the knobs from the top to the side.</p>

            <h2>Display</h2>
            <p>I placed this device in a public setting. In my imagination, the glasses can be used at any time.</p>
