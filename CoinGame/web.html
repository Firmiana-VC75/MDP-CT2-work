                    <p>In this project, I wanted to develop a gold coin eating game through Unity.
                    The inspiration for the game is Metro Runner. I've loved this game since middle school and I still play it today.
                    I refer to the tutorials of the game on the tube. This tutorial is very useful.</p>

                        <p>I started out using squares as player models, and also modeled walls after cubes.
                            I also designed the finish line at the end of the runway.</p>

                            When a player touches a wall the game fails. Players can get points by colliding gold coins.</p>

                        <p>I encountered multiple technical challenges during the development process.
                            The video clearly documents that when I tested it, all the gold coins flew away.</p>
                        <video src="video/problem.mp4" controls alt="Challenges"></video>
                        <p>I tried many things: like combining coins, or adding rigdbody to each coin.
                            I even restarted unity. However the problem is still not solved.
                        Until I realized that there is something wrong with the model of the gold coins.
                        Because my gold coin model is downloaded from the internet, it is a prefab.
                        I didn't release the package body when I copied and pasted it, which caused my code can't apply to each gold coin.
                        I ended up re-adding each gold coin as a separate model and this problem was solved.</p>
