            <h2>My Concept</h2>
            <p>
                In this project, I wanted to develop a gold coin eating game through Unity.
                The inspiration for the game is Metro Runner. I've loved this game since middle school and I still play it today.
                I refer to the tutorials of the game on the tube. This tutorial is very useful.

            <h2>Modeling</h2>
            <p>
                I started out using squares as player models, and also modeled walls after cubes.
                I also designed the finish line at the end of the runway.

            <h2>Intercations</h2>
            <p>
                I have collision triggers and a points mechanic in the game.
                When a player touches a wall the game fails. Players can get points by colliding gold coins.

                Depressed areas need to be filled with water.
                At the same time I used the smoothing brush to make the mountain paths,
                and the plains where the house is placed.

            <h2>Challenges </h2>
            <p>
                I encountered multiple technical challenges during the development process.
                The video clearly documents that when I tested it, all the gold coins flew away.
            </p>
            <div class="image-grid">
                <video src="video/problem.mp4" controls alt="problem"></video>   

                <p>I tried many things: like combining coins, or adding rigdbody to each coin.
                    I even restarted unity. However the problem is still not solved.
                Until I realized that there is something wrong with the model of the gold coins.
                Because my gold coin model is downloaded from the internet, it is a prefab.
                I didn't release the package body when I copied and pasted it, which caused my code can't apply to each gold coin.
                I ended up re-adding each gold coin as a separate model and this problem was solved.</p>

            <h2>Visual</h2>
            <p>
                Finally, I added some details: adjusted lighting, added gold coin rotation animation,
                replaced player model with a truck.

            <h2>Arduino and Hardware</h2>
            <p>
                I spent a lot of time for the game and the Arduino link.
                The numerical references were hard to define and I had to try different values
                over and over again to achieve the desired effect. The prefect value is 5!
